EA Sports, developed a video game.
They designed a game in such a way that, there are L number of levels from 1 to L.
There are D number of dependencies where each dependency[m] = [ Xm, Ym ], represents
a prerequisite relationship, that is, in order to play level-Ym,  
you must have completed the level-Xm . 

In one day you can complete any number of levels as long as you have completed all 
the prerequisites levels in the game.
