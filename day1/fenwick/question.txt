Malika taught a new fun time program practice for Engineering Students.
As a part of this she has given set of numbers, and asked the students 
to find the sum of numbers between indices S1 and S2 (S1<=S2), inclusive.

Now itâ€™s your task to implement the Solution class:
	- Solution(int[] nums) : Initializes the object with the integer array nums .
	- int sum(int S1, int S2) Returns the sum of the subarray nums[S1, S2] 
	(i.e., nums[S1] + nums[S1 + 1], ..., nums[S2] ).


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer n, size of the array nums[] (set of numbers).
		where 1<= n <= 50000
Line-2: Two integers S1 and S2, index positions 
		where 0 <= S1 <= S2 < n
		and 1<= nums[i] <= 9999.

Output Format:
--------------
An integer, sum of integers between indices(s1, s2).


Sample Input-1:
---------------
8
2 6

Sample Output-1:
----------------
34562

NOTE: First 8 values of the input are: 9530 5518 8598 4698 6726 5259 9281 827
